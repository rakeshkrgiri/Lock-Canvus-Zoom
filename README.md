# Lock Canvas Zoom Plugin for QGIS

## Description
The **Lock Canvas Zoom** plugin for QGIS allows you to lock or unlock the zoom functionality of the map canvas. This is useful when you want to maintain a fixed zoom level while interacting with other features or tools in QGIS, preventing accidental zooming in or out.

## Features
- **Lock/Unlock Zoom**: Lock the zoom level on the map canvas to prevent accidental zooming.
- **Toolbar Icon**: A toggle button appears on the QGIS toolbar that switches between a lock icon (locked zoom) and an unlock icon (unlocked zoom).
- **No CRS Dependency**: The lock/unlock zoom functionality works consistently across all coordinate reference systems (CRS) in QGIS.
- **Seamless Interaction**: Easily lock or unlock the zoom without affecting your QGIS project.

## Installation

1. Download and install the **Lock Canvas Zoom** plugin via the [QGIS Plugin Repository](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/LockCanvasZoom/).
2. Once installed, the plugin will automatically add a toggle button to the QGIS toolbar.
3. Click the lock icon to lock the zoom level, and click the unlock icon to return to normal zoom functionality.

## Usage
- After installation, you will see a new toolbar button with a lock icon. 
- Click on the lock icon to lock the zoom level of the map canvas.
- Once locked, zooming in or out via the mouse wheel or other zoom controls will be disabled.
- Clicking the button again will unlock the zoom, allowing you to zoom freely once more.

## Requirements
- QGIS 3.x or higher.
